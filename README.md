Built With

The website is built with popular web technologies, React makes it painless to create interactive UIs, CSS Modules for modular and reusable CSS, Redux Toolkit for managing application state, and TMDB

**React** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

**Redux Toolkit** - Redux Toolkit is a set of opinionated libraries and utilities for building Redux applications. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for managing application state, as well as many other helpful utilities and features.

**CSS Modules** Modular and reusable CSS! No more conflicts.Explicit dependencies.No global scope. CSS files in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. CSS Modules compile to a low-level interchange format called ICSS or Interoperable CSS, but are written like normal CSS files.

**TMDB API** - The TMDB API is an API for accessing movies and movie related data. It allows developers to integrate TMDB's movie recognition technology into their own applications and build new movie-related experiences.
